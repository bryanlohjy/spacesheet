# Font Spreadsheet
An application to sample a latent space of fonts generated by [Erik Bern's deepfonts model](https://erikbern.com/2016/01/21/analyzing-50k-fonts-using-deep-neural-networks.html).

Sampling of the latent space is done with deeplearn.js. A computational graph is built using pretrained weights and biases ported from the deepfonts network.

The interface is built with React, with the goal of being independent from the deeplearn.js model.

## To do:
- Encoder
- Map of fonts
- Spreadsheet
